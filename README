This project is not optimized for security measures, as there is no need for a displayed version of packets in actual security environments; this is meant to illustrate web connections to contractors or potentially a presentation. This was coded with the intention of Wireshark Dump files, while it's potentially compatible with other files, it's strongly recommended to use files from Wireshark.
